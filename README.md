# deep_learning_demo

This is a demo of a multi layer neural network.
It contains an implementation of automatic differentiation for computing the gradients during learning.

It's still work in progress.
The goal is to have a very simple and straight forward implementation for demoing the inner workings of DNNs.
I'm programming it while learning it myself.
